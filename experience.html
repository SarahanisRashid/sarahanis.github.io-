<center><font style="background-color: powderblue; font-size: 25px; font-family: serif; border: 4px solid green;"> In order to improve myself to be bettter, I have joined some talks and programs that help me to increase my social skill, self-esteem,discipline and creativity. The latest program that I joined is "How to be a leader, not a boss". I have gained lots of knowledge that help me to identify what kind of leadership that makes me achieve the goals and be success. Other than that, I have the experience 
to be one of the committe's members in a program in which that program is organized by my group class. It was such a good experience and give the deep meaning for myself. </center></font> <br><br>
