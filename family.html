<font style="background-color: lightblue;  font-size: 20px; font-family: serif">My Mom and Dad was blessed with 7 daughters and 2 sons. I am number 7 out of 9 siblings, so I have 1 brother and 5 sisters, and 1 little sister and 1 little brother. Funny, crazy, silly and caring! These are the perfect words to describe my family. Thank God for giving me a very beautiful family, I could not ask more than this!

Meet my lovely family:)
